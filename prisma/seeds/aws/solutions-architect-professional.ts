            explanation: 'Comprehensive observability strategy: Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing across microservices, implement centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs and log aggregation, use CloudWatch Metrics with custom metrics and dimensions, implement synthetic monitoring with CloudWatch Synthetics, use AWS Health Dashboard for service health monitoring, implement application performance monitoring (APM) with third-party tools, use VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring, implement security monitoring with GuardDuty and Security Hub, use AWS Config for configuration drift monitoring, implement cost monitoring with Cost Explorer and Budgets, use CloudWatch Alarms with automated responses, implement log analysis with CloudWatch Insights and Elasticsearch, use CloudWatch Dashboards for visualization, implement SLI/SLO monitoring with proper alerting, establish on-call procedures and runbooks, and implement chaos engineering for resilience testing.
