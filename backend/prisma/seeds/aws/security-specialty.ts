            explanation: 'AWS API and microservices security: API Gateway with authentication (Cognito, IAM, Lambda authorizers), throttling and usage plans, request/response validation, AWS WAF integration for Layer 7 protection, VPC endpoints for private API access, API Gateway resource policies, AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS, CloudWatch for API monitoring and logging, X-Ray for distributed tracing, AWS App Mesh for service mesh security policies, ECS/EKS task-level IAM roles, service-to-service authentication with IAM roles, Secrets Manager for API credentials, and integration with AWS Security services. Implement proper API versioning, rate limiting, and security testing in CI/CD pipelines. Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/security.html',

            explanation: 'AWS database security implementation: Enable encryption at rest using KMS for RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift, and DocumentDB, implement SSL/TLS encryption in transit, use IAM database authentication where supported, implement VPC security groups and NACLs for network-level protection, enable database activity monitoring and logging, use RDS Enhanced Monitoring for detailed metrics, implement proper backup encryption and retention, use database parameter groups for security configuration, implement read replicas in separate security zones, use AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials, enable AWS Config for database configuration compliance, implement database-level firewalls and access controls, and use AWS Database Migration Service for secure migrations. Regular security patching and vulnerability assessments are essential. Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds/latest/userguide/Overview.Encryption.html',
