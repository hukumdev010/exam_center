## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Run the Organized Seed System
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/seed_organized.py
```

### Count Certifications
```bash
python scripts/count_organized.py
```

### Legacy Seed (Still Works)

```

## 📝 Individual Certification File Format

Each certification file follows this structure:

```python
"""Certification Name"""

CERTIFICATION = {
    "name": "Full Certification Name",
    "description": "Description of what this certification covers",
    "slug": "unique-certification-slug",
    "level": "Foundational|Associate|Professional|Expert|Specialty",
    "duration": 90,  # minutes
    "questions_count": 65,  # total questions in real exam
    "category_slug": "category-name",
    "is_active": True
}

QUESTIONS = [
    {
        "text": "What is the question?",
        "explanation": "Detailed explanation of the correct answer",
        "reference": "https://documentation-link",
        "points": 1,
        "answers": [
            {"text": "Option A", "is_correct": False},
            {"text": "Option B", "is_correct": True},
            {"text": "Option C", "is_correct": False},
            {"text": "Option D", "is_correct": False}
        ]
    }
    # Add more questions...
]
```

## 🔧 Adding New Certifications

### Option 1: Add to Existing Organized Category
1. Create new file: `certifications/category_name/new_cert.py`
2. Follow the file format above
3. Update `certifications/category_name/__init__.py` to import the new file
4. Test with `python scripts/count_organized.py`

### Option 2: Create New Organized Category
1. Create folder: `certifications/new_category/`
2. Add certifications as individual files
3. Create `__init__.py` to collect all certifications
4. Add category to `categories.py`
5. Test the system

### Option 3: Migrate Legacy Category
1. Create organized folder structure
2. Split large legacy file into individual certification files
3. Create `__init__.py` collector
4. Remove old legacy imports

## 📈 Migration Progress

### ✅ Fully Organized (Individual Files)
- **AWS** (5 files) - Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect, Developer, Security
- **Linux** (4 files) - CompTIA Linux+, RHCSA, RHCE, LPIC-1
- **System Design** (3 files) - Fundamentals, Microservices, High-Performance
- **Cybersecurity** (2 files) - Security+, Ethical Hacker

### 📁 Legacy (Single Files) - Ready for Migration
- Azure, Google Cloud, DevOps, Programming, Data Analytics, Project Management, Networking, Database

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Migrate remaining categories** to organized structure
2. **Add more Linux certifications** (SUSE, Ubuntu, etc.)
3. **Expand System Design** certifications (Database Design, API Design, etc.)
4. **Add more Cybersecurity** certifications (CISSP, CISM, etc.)

### Medium Priority
1. **Add more questions** to existing certifications (target: 50-100 per cert)
2. **Create practice exams** with full question sets
3. **Add certification prerequisites** and learning paths
4. **Implement difficulty levels** for questions

### Long Term
1. **Add certification expiration dates** and renewal requirements
2. **Create adaptive testing** algorithms
3. **Add performance analytics** and progress tracking
4. **Implement certification badges** and achievements

## 📊 Structure Validation

Run these commands to validate the structure:

```bash
# Count all certifications
python scripts/count_organized.py

# Test database seeding
python scripts/seed_organized.py

# Verify structure integrity
find seed_data/certifications -name "*.py" | wc -l
```
